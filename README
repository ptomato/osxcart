The Osxcart Library

Osxcart, or OS X Converting And Reading Tool, is a library designed to import 
file formats used in Mac OS X, NeXTSTEP, and GnuSTEP into GTK+/GLib-based 
programs easily, using a lightweight interface. The "s" in Osxcart is silent.

Right now, the Osxcart library includes a module for reading and writing 
property lists (".plist" files) in XML format, and a module for importing and 
exporting RTF documents to and from GtkTextBuffers.

How To Use It

The API documentation can be found in the docs/reference/html directory. It is
also available in Devhelp after 'make install' has been run.
